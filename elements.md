# Element Functionality

In this system, elements have specific strengths, weaknesses, and immunities relative to one another. Spells are categorized into two types: attack and healing. Here’s how they interact:

- **Attack Spells:**
  - **Strengths:** An attack spell is particularly effective against elements that are weak to it. For example, using a Fire attack spell on an Ice elemental exploits Ice’s weakness to Fire, causing increased damage.
  - **Weaknesses:** An attack spell will be less effective if it targets an element that is resistant to it. For instance, using a Water attack spell on an Ice elemental may be less effective because Ice has some degree of resistance to Water.
  - **Immunities:** If an attack spell is used against an element that is immune to it, the spell will have no effect. For example, using a Water attack spell on an Ice elemental may be completely ineffective due to Ice’s immunity to Water.
- **Healing Spells:**
  - **Effectiveness:** Healing spells will generally have an enhanced effect if they align with the elemental’s nature. For example, using a Nature healing spell on a Fire elemental would be extra effective, as Nature supports and fuels Fire.
  - **Reduced Effectiveness:** If a healing spell is not aligned with the elemental’s nature, it may still provide some benefit, but with reduced effectiveness. For example, using a Water healing spell on a Fire elemental would heal less effectively.

This system ensures that while elements have clear interactions, healers will always be able to heal, though the effectiveness of their healing spells may vary based on the elemental nature of the target.

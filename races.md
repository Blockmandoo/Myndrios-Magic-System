## Mountain Dwarves

- **Description:** A distinct subrace of dwarves, Mountain Dwarves are hardier and more reclusive than their cousins, living deep within high, rugged mountain ranges. Taller and even more robust than standard Dwarves, Mountain Dwarves are known for their exceptional endurance, resilience, and unparalleled skill in mining and stonework. Their long lifespans allow them to perfect their craft over centuries, and their bodies are built to thrive in harsh, cold climates and rocky terrains.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Rockbound Fortitude:** Mountain Dwarves have a heightened resistance to physical damage and environmental hazards like extreme cold or high altitudes.
  - **Mountain's Might:** Their innate strength allows them to perform feats of raw power, such as moving large boulders or dealing devastating blows in battle.

  - **Stoneward Grit:** In battle, Mountain Dwarves are nearly unyielding, capable of withstanding blows that would fell lesser beings, making them prime defenders and heavily armored fighters.
- **Culture:** Mountain Dwarves live in vast, highly defensible underground cities carved into the highest peaks and deepest caves. Their society is built around a strict hierarchy, where the oldest and most skilled craftsmen and warriors hold positions of power. They are even more insular than other dwarves, valuing self-sufficiency and security. Mountain Dwarves place immense pride in their ability to thrive in harsh environments, and their fortresses are built with painstaking attention to detail, making them nearly impenetrable. They tend to be more reserved and less trusting of outsiders, but within their communities, they are bound by deep traditions of brotherhood, loyalty, and honor. Religion often centers around gods of stone, earth, and the forge.
- **General Regard:** Mountain Dwarves are respected for their unmatched strength, endurance, and architectural mastery. Outsiders admire their grand, fortress-like cities and unyielding nature, but may view them as cold and unwelcoming due to their reclusive ways. However, in times of need, their skill as warriors and artisans makes them highly sought-after allies, particularly in wars where defensive strongholds or siege-breaking are required.

<!--

## Hill Dwarves

- **Description:** Hill Dwarves are a more outwardly sociable and adaptable subrace compared to their Mountain Dwarf cousins. Living in sprawling underground cities beneath rolling hills and forests, they are still stout and resilient, but their connection to the surface world gives them a broader perspective. They are slightly shorter and less robust than Mountain Dwarves, but they make up for it with greater ingenuity and an increased affinity for trade and diplomacy with other races.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Enduring Toughness:** While not as hardy as Mountain Dwarves, Hill Dwarves possess exceptional stamina and resilience, able to withstand long periods of labor or travel and recover quickly from injuries.
  - **Master Miner:** Skilled in extracting precious gems and metals from the earth, Hill Dwarves excel at both mining and identifying valuable resources, though their focus is often on trade rather than just self-sufficiency.
  - **Hearthbound Defender:** Hill Dwarves are exceptional protectors of their homes and communities, able to fortify their settlements and repel invaders through clever tactics and defensive ingenuity.
  - **Diplomatic Craftsmanship:** Known for crafting fine goods—especially jewelry, weapons, and tools—Hill Dwarves often barter and trade with other races, giving them a reputation for being fair but shrewd merchants.
- **Culture:** Unlike the more isolated Mountain Dwarves, Hill Dwarves maintain frequent contact with surface-dwelling races, often engaging in trade and alliances with humans, elves, and others. Their cities are still underground, but they are built closer to the surface, often nestled in large hills and forested areas. They value craftsmanship, but their focus is on creating goods for trade rather than just for internal use. Hill Dwarves are deeply family-oriented, and their society revolves around community and cooperation. They often form close-knit relationships with other races, and their leaders tend to be merchants or elder craftsmen who excel in diplomacy. Festivals and celebrations of craft and harvest are central to their culture, emphasizing their connection to both the earth and the cycles of nature.
- **General Regard:** Hill Dwarves are highly regarded as reliable traders and artisans, respected for their honesty, hard work, and ability to forge meaningful alliances. Their goods are often seen as some of the finest available, especially when it comes to jewelry, tools, and practical items. While they are not as insular as Mountain Dwarves, they are still protective of their homes and families, and their defensive tactics are admired by other races. Their approachable nature makes them popular allies, but they are also respected for their ability to negotiate shrewdly, ensuring fair deals in any trade or alliance.

<!--

- **Abilities:** Skilled in agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade, but still excellent builders and warriors.
- **Culture:** More open and friendly, with a focus on trade and diplomacy with other races.
-->

## Dark Dwarves

- **Description:** Dark Dwarves, sometimes referred to as Deep Dwarves or Duergar in some worlds, are a reclusive and often malevolent subrace of dwarves who dwell in the deepest, darkest parts of the earth. Unlike their surface-dwelling kin, Dark Dwarves have adapted to life in the shadows and are known for their cruelty, cunning, and mastery of dark, forbidden magic. They tend to be paler, with ashen skin and deep-set, glowing eyes, and are physically hardened by the hostile environments they call home.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Shadowforge Mastery:** Dark Dwarves possess the rare ability to infuse their forged weapons and armor with dark magic, creating items imbued with curses, shadow energy, or mind-affecting effects.
  - **Umbral Cloak:** Dark Dwarves can blend into the shadows, becoming nearly invisible in low-light environments, making them expert ambushers and assassins.
  - **Psionic Resilience:** Due to the harsh environments and dark magics they often encounter, Dark Dwarves have developed resistance to mind-altering spells and psychic attacks.
  - **Dark Vision:** Dark Dwarves can see in complete darkness, allowing them to navigate and fight in the pitch-black depths of their underground homes without difficulty.
- **Culture:** Dark Dwarves are a highly secretive and militaristic society, ruled by strict hierarchies and often driven by conquest or the acquisition of power. Their cities are fortress-like labyrinths, deep underground, and are built around forges that produce enchanted weapons and cruel machinery. The Dark Dwarves place great value on strength, ambition, and control, often practicing slavery and raiding weaker settlements. They are deeply distrustful of outsiders, including other dwarven subraces, and often engage in underground warfare with them. Their religion often revolves around dark deities, or even primal forces of shadow and earth, which they believe grant them their power. Unlike surface dwarves, who revere the balance of earth and craftsmanship, Dark Dwarves focus on domination, control, and bending the world to their will. Despite this, they maintain a rigid sense of order within their own society, where ambition and power can lead to rapid advancement, but treachery is equally common.
- **General Regard:** Dark Dwarves are largely feared and distrusted by the surface races, often viewed as brutal slavers, raiders, and sorcerers. Their reputation for cruelty and manipulation precedes them, and their dealings with outsiders are usually transactional at best. Despite this, the craftsmanship of Dark Dwarves is highly sought after—albeit at a great cost—since their weapons and armor are imbued with powerful and often malevolent magic. They are seen as dangerous and cunning adversaries, yet there is a certain dark respect for their mastery of shadow magic and their ability to survive in the hostile depths of the underworld.

<!--
- **Description:** Dwarves who dwell deep underground, often in dark, cursed cities.
- **Abilities:** Masters of stealth, shadow magic, and psionics. Duergar are typically grim and dour.
- **Culture:** Harsh and authoritarian, with a society based on conquest and survival in hostile environments.
-->

## Frost Dwarves

- **Description:** Frost Dwarves are a rare subrace of dwarves who inhabit the frozen tundras and icy mountains of the world. Their bodies have adapted to the harsh cold, giving them thicker skin, frost-resistant beards, and a natural resistance to freezing temperatures. Slightly taller than other dwarves, they are known for their resilience, resourcefulness, and deep connection to ice and snow. Their skin often has a bluish tint, and their eyes gleam with an icy, pale hue.
- **Abilities:**
  - **Frost Resistance:** Frost Dwarves are immune to the effects of extreme cold, making them perfectly suited for surviving and thriving in frozen environments.
  - **Ice Shaper:** Some Frost Dwarves possess the ability to manipulate ice and snow, shaping it into tools, weapons, or structures. This magic allows them to craft ice fortresses or freeze their enemies in combat.
  - **Cold Forged:** Frost Dwarves excel at forging weapons and armor designed for use in freezing climates. Their metalwork is often reinforced with enchanted ice, making it both beautiful and highly durable.
  - **Blizzardborn:** In battle, Frost Dwarves can summon localized blizzards or frost storms, hindering enemy movement and providing cover for themselves or their allies.
- **Culture:** Frost Dwarf society is built around survival in the most inhospitable conditions. Their cities, carved into icy caverns or built atop frozen peaks, are marvels of ice architecture, utilizing enchanted ice to build towering strongholds that endure the coldest temperatures. Frost Dwarves place great value on endurance, unity, and survival. They have a strong warrior culture, where the ability to endure harsh environments and defend their frozen homes is revered. Frost Dwarves are also excellent hunters and fishermen, relying on the scarce resources of their frozen surroundings. They have a deep respect for the land and the forces of nature, often worshipping deities or elemental spirits of ice and winter. While they are generally more isolationist, preferring to remain in their cold domains, Frost Dwarves are not as distrustful of outsiders as Dark Dwarves. They will trade and form alliances, especially with those who respect their ways or seek their expertise in ice magic and cold-forged weaponry.
- **General Regard:** Frost Dwarves are both respected and feared for their mastery of ice and their ability to survive in extreme cold. They are seen as hardy, disciplined warriors and craftspeople, and their cold-forged weapons and armor are prized among warriors and collectors alike. However, their remote, frozen homelands make them a rare sight in warmer climates, and their stoic, no-nonsense demeanor can make them seem distant or unapproachable to outsiders. Despite this, they are admired for their unwavering resilience, and many see them as symbols of endurance and survival against all odds.

<!--
- **Description:** Dwarves who thrive in cold, icy environments.

They are typically slender, tall, and have sharp, pointed ears. Elves possess a natural affinity for magic, and their society is steeped in tradition, with many elves dedicating their lives to the pursuit of art, knowledge, and the mastery of their magical abilities.

Elves value wisdom, patience, and balance, often seeing themselves as stewards of the land. They have a strong sense of tradition and community, with many elven societies governed by councils of elders or powerful mages. Artistic pursuits such as music, poetry, and sculpture are highly regarded, as elves believe that life should be filled with beauty and harmony. However, their long lives can also make them somewhat aloof and detached from the concerns of shorter-lived races, leading to an air of superiority. Elves tend to be cautious when interacting with other races, valuing diplomacy and peace but willing to defend their realms fiercely when threatened. Some elven subraces are more reclusive, while others maintain active relationships with humans, dwarves, and other races.
- **General Regard:** Elves are widely respected for their wisdom, magical prowess, and elegance, though their long lives and occasional aloofness can lead to tensions with other races, especially those with shorter lifespans. Many admire their artistry and connection to nature, but some view elves as arrogant or distant. Nonetheless, elven craftsmanship—particularly their magical items and archery—are highly sought after, and their knowledge of magic and ancient history makes them invaluable allies in many conflicts.

They are often taller and more regal in appearance than other elves, with sharp features, golden or silver hair, and striking eyes that glow with magical energy.

They often govern through a council of powerful mages or noble families, who rule with a strong sense of order and tradition. High Elves have a reputation for being somewhat elitist, believing their mastery of magic and knowledge gives them a special place in the world. They see themselves as protectors of magical balance and often take on the role of guardians of ancient arcane secrets. However, this sense of superiority can lead to tensions with other races, particularly those who do not share their reverence for magic or those who live more chaotic or less disciplined lives. Despite their aloofness, High Elves are deeply invested in preserving the beauty of their world. They are patrons of art, music, and culture, and their works of magical craftsmanship—be they weapons, armor, or enchanted artifacts—are known across the realms for their perfection and rarity.
- **General Regard:** High Elves are admired for their magical prowess, their sophisticated culture, and their beauty, but they are also seen as distant, proud, and sometimes condescending. Many races seek their wisdom in matters of magic, but their reluctance to involve themselves in the affairs of "lesser" races can create tension. Their cities are renowned for their enchantments and beauty, and their craftsmanship, particularly in the creation of magical items, is highly coveted. However, High Elves' sense of superiority sometimes makes them difficult allies, as they prefer to control situations from behind the scenes rather than engage directly in political or military matters.

Unlike their High Elf cousins, they shun grand cities in favor of living in harmony with forests, jungles, and other natural landscapes. They are slightly shorter than other elves, with lean, athletic builds, and their features often reflect their surroundings—earthy skin tones, brown or green eyes, and hair that blends with the colors of the forest. Wood Elves are known for their agility, their expertise in archery, and their ability to move swiftly and silently through the wild.

Their society places great emphasis on survival skills, archery, and guerrilla tactics, as Wood Elves often defend their forests from invaders using their knowledge of the land to their advantage. Though they are not as interested in the grand magical arts as their High Elf cousins, they do possess a deep understanding of nature magic, particularly in areas related to healing, growth, and the manipulation of flora and fauna. Wood Elves are typically more open than High Elves but still cautious of outsiders. They are more likely to form alliances with other races, especially those who share their reverence for nature or respect the forest’s boundaries. They are also known to be fierce protectors of their homeland, launching swift and devastating attacks against any who threaten the balance of the natural world.
- **General Regard:** Wood Elves are respected for their skill in archery, their deep connection to nature, and their expertise in guerrilla warfare. They are admired by those who seek harmony with the wild, and their knowledge of herbalism, nature magic, and survival is highly valued. However, they can be distrustful of outsiders, particularly those who exploit or harm the natural world. While less aloof than High Elves, they are often viewed as elusive and secretive, with a tendency to remain neutral in wider political matters unless the natural world is directly threatened.

Their culture is heavily influenced by their harsh environment and their need to be constantly vigilant. They often worship deities associated with darkness, chaos, and ambition, and their religious practices include rituals that reinforce their connection to the shadows and the powers of the underground. Dark Elves are known for their cruel and ruthless behavior, both towards enemies and within their own society, where betrayal and backstabbing are common. Despite their often malevolent reputation, Dark Elves have a rich cultural heritage, with a focus on art, magic, and the mastery of underground survival. Their craftsmanship in creating weapons, armor, and magical items is highly esteemed, though it is often tainted by the darker aspects of their culture.
- **General Regard:** Dark Elves are feared and mistrusted by many surface races due to their reputation for treachery, cruelty, and dark magic. They are known as formidable enemies and cunning manipulators, with their skills in stealth and poison making them dangerous adversaries. While some admire their magical prowess and the beauty of their dark art, many view them as sinister and untrustworthy. Their preference for living in isolation, coupled with their ruthlessness, often leads to strained relationships with other races, and their cities are seen as mysterious and perilous places.
